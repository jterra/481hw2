The code is built and run through Eclipse.


The game is an Android Connect Four app. The layout is a 6x7 grid, where each
item of the grid is a button. 2 players take turns placing pieces in the board,
where pieces must be placed either on the bottom row or in a row directly
above another piece. The players' objective is to get four pieces in a row,
either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

In the app, to place a piece, click on an empty space which is valid for
placement. The space is filled with your piece and the turn changes. The game
continues in this fashion until one player has won, or until the whole board
has been filled. If the whole board is filled without a win, there is a Draw.

The player may exit the app by pressing the "Quit" button.
